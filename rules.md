# Rules

Degens bets will either pay out completely to the winner or be settled at the [cancellation price](#/protocol?id=finalization-prices). Unless otherwise posted, the cancellation price is 50, meaning positions are split evenly.

Cancellation will occur in any of the following cases:

* Cancelled or abandoned by league/organizers for any reason
* Event start time postponed or moved to a different day
* If an event is suspended before it is completed and is not resumed on the same day
* Any other material changes to the match details
* Sport-specific cancellation reasons (see below)
