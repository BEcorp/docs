Degens bets will either pay out completely to the winner or be settled at the [cancellation price](/protocol?id=finalization-prices). The cancellation prices for each market can be seen by clicking on the "i" icon next to the market type.

Cancellation will occur in any of the following cases:

* If an event is suspended before it is completed and is not resumed on the same day
* Any other material changes to the match details
